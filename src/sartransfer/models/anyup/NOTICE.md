Only the inference code is kept (model + layers + two utils). Training code,
the NATTEN attention variant, backbones, dataloaders and visualisation are not
included. Files are unmodified. Weights (`anyup_multi_backbone.pth`, 3.5 MB,
released by the authors at
https://github.com/wimmerth/anyup/releases/download/checkpoint_v2/anyup_multi_backbone.pth)
are downloaded from that release into the Drive model cache when missing, checked by size
and full SHA-256, and loaded from there -- no torch.hub.

Changes - none to the code. This folder exists so the project has no runtime
dependency on the upstream repository.
